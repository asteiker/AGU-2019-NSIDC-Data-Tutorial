## Summary

The NSIDC DAAC provides a wide variety of remote sensing data on the cryosphere, often with disparate coverage and resolution. This tutorial will demonstrate our data discovery, access, and subsetting services, along with basic open source resources used to harmonize and analyze data across these diverse products. The tutorial will be presented as a series of Python-based Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on sea ice height and ice surface temperature data from NASAâ€™s ICESat-2 and MODIS missions, respectively, to characterize Arctic sea ice. No coding experience or computing prerequisites are required, though some familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks is recommended.

## Key Learning Objectives

1) Become familiar with NSIDC resources, including user support documents, data access options, and data subsetting services.

2) Learn how to access and subset data programmatically using the NSIDC DAAC's API service. 

3) Learn about the coverage, resolution, and structure of sea ice data from new NASA ICESat-2 mission.

3) Interact with ICESat-2 and MODIS data using basic Python science libraries to visualize, filter, and plot concurrent data.
