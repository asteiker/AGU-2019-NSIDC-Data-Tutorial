## Summary
The NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) distributes a wide variety of remote sensing data on the cryosphere as well as other earth science parameters. Between the NSIDC DAAC and other NASA DAACs, nearly all aspects of the earthâ€™s environment are addressed by NASA data. However, the various data products are often complex and have varying formats, grids, and coverage, with disparate measurement quality and resolution. Numerous data product-specific tools and services have been developed to cater to these unique characteristics, but harmonizing these heterogeneous data is often a challenge for the earth science community. For example, simply converting between different projections and grids can be difficult. In addition, data volume continues to increase with high resolution instruments onboard the latest NASA earth science missions, posing challenges to accessing and processing data with limited compute resources

This tutorial will provide hands-on guidance to accessing, visualizing, transforming, and unifying data from the NSIDC DAAC for land and sea ice applications. 

## Key Learning Objectives
Become familiar with NSIDC resources, including user support documents, data access options, and data customization services.
Learn the basics of Jupyter Notebooks: Why and when to use them, how to access and interact with them today, how to access and interact with them outside of the tutorial. 
Interact with NSIDC DAAC data using fundamental Python science libraries: Learn how to access, visualize, and analyze data across various remote sensing data levels, formats, and structures.
