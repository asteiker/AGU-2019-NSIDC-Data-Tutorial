## Summary

The NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) distributes a wide variety of remote sensing data on the cryosphere. These data sets provide unique measurement variables along with disparate formats, grids, coverage, and resolution, posing unique challenges when attempting to harmonize and analyze data across these varying products. This tutorial will address some of these challenges by providing hands-on guidance to accessing, visualizing, transforming, and unifying data from the NSIDC DAAC for land and sea ice applications. 

## Key Learning Objectives

1) Become familiar with NSIDC resources, including user support documents, data access options, and data customization services.

2) Learn the basics of Jupyter Notebooks: Why and when to use them, how to access and interact with them today, how to access and interact with them outside of the tutorial. 

3) Interact with NSIDC DAAC data using fundamental Python science libraries: Learn how to access, visualize, and analyze data across various remote sensing data levels, formats, and structures.
