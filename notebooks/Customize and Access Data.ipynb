    "# Discover, Customize and Access NSIDC DAAC Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based off of the [NSIDC-Data-Access-Notebook](https://github.com/nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Access-Notebook) provided through NSIDC's Github organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've visualized our study areas, we will first explore data coverage, size, and customization (subsetting, reformatting, reprojection) service availability, and then access those associated files. The `Data access for all datasets` notebook provides the steps needed to subset and download all the data we'll be using in the final `Visualize and Analyze Data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "___A note on data access options:___\n",
    "We will be pursuing data discovery and access \"programmatically\" using Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What is an API?* You can think of an API as a middle man between an application or end-use (in this case, us) and a data provider. In this case, the data provider is both the metadata repository housing data information (the Common Metadata Repository, or CMR) and NSIDC as the data distributor. These APIs are generally structured as a URL with a base plus individual key-value-pairs separated by ‘&’.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other discovery and access methods available from NSIDC as we walked through in the `Introduction` notebook, including access from the data set landing page 'Download Data' tab (e.g. [ATL07 Data Access](https://nsidc.org/data/atl07?qt-data_set_tabs=1#qt-data_set_tabs)) and [NASA Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you will learn in this customize and access notebook:\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Search for data programmatically using the Common Metadata Repository API by time and area of interest.\n",
    "2. Determine subsetting, reformatting, and reprojection capabilities for our data of interest.\n",
    "3. Access and customize data using NSIDC's data access and service API.\n",
