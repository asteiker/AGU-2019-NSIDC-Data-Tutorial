    "### Sea Ice use case: Explore how ICESat-2 can help map fast ice\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle 2, Track 1298, March 23, 2019. The track crosses the East Siberian Sea, going from land to fast ice, to drift ice including some new ice growth, and is nearly completely clear sky. The thought here is that ICESat-2 could potentially help map fast ice, which is rather difficult to do automatically with satellite imagery. My thought is that the fast ice should have less height/freeboard variability - less surface roughness. It also crosses new ice in a flaw lead as the drift ice moves away from the fast ice edge. So there is a good graduation of ice thickness from new ice to thicker first-year ice. So this could show how well ICESat-2 performs at different ice thicknesses. We could use MODIS reflectance to estimate thin ice thickness, and/or we could also use SMAP. The other neat thing is that there is a cross-over with another track, 1305, on the same day. So could look at the cross-over and compare elevation/freeboard. This point is over drift ice, so it likely wouldn’t be the same floe since it’s 7 orbits later (~12 hours), but if nothing else it would demonstrate how to compare cross-over. (We could use all six beams to get the full 36 crossovers, or maybe just the 3 strong beams to get 9 crossovers - that might be able to capture some of the same floes).\n",
