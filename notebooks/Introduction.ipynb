    "    - Background from Walt: \"Fast ice should have less height/freeboard variability - less surface roughness. It also crosses new ice in a flaw lead as the drift ice moves away from the fast ice edge. So there is a good graduation of ice thickness from new ice to thicker first-year ice. So this could show how how well ICESat-2 performs at different ice thicknesses. We could use MODIS reflectance to estimate thin ice thickness. ICESat-2 should provide us with a profile of height across these surfaces.\"\n",

It picks up at ~73.8, with a few data points. I think that’s mainly because ATL10 doesn’t get data within 50 km of land. After those few points, there are only a couple of points until ~74.5. This probably because there are no leads over the fast ice, so it loses its sea level calibration point and can’t get valid freeboard values. Then there is the island and the freeboard values pick up at ~76.3 N. This gap reflects the 50 km land buffer and possibly low quality retrievals over thin ice (e.g., signal to noise is too low for thin ice). So the use case is that ATL07 seems to be getting a signal from the thin ice, but the ATL10 quality/confidence level filters don’t allow retrieval of freeboard, which is appropriate. But one could use the MODIS IST to get freeboard from ATL07 where ATL10 doesn’t have freeboard values, using a simple IST vs. height/freeboard relationship.\"\n",
